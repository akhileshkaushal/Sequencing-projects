Enhancer sequences are regulatory DNA sequences that, when bound by specific proteins called transcription factors, enhance the transcription of an associated gene. Regulation of transcription is the most common form of gene control, and the activity of transcription factors allows genes to be specifically regulated during development and in different types of cells.(Source: https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/enhancer-163). The term 'super-enhancer' has been used to describe groups of putative enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of Mediator binding, as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq).

Super Enhancer identification is based upon the method described in McKeown MR, Corces MR, Eaton ML, Fiore C, Lee E, Lopez JT, Chen MW, Smith D, Chan SM, Koenig JL et al: Superenhancer Analysis Defines Novel Epigenomic Subtypes of Non-APL AML, Including an RARalpha Dependency Targetable by SY-1425, a Potent and Selective RARalpha Agonist.
